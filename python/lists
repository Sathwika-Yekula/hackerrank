Consider a list (list = []). You can perform the following commands:

     1. insert i e: Insert integer e at position i.
     2. print: Print the list.
     3. remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer e .
     4. append e: Insert integer e at the end of the list. 
     5. sort: Sort the list.
     6. pop: Pop the last element from the list.
     7. reverse: Reverse the list
.
      Initialize your list and read in the value of n followed by n lines of commands where each command will be of the 7 types listed above. Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list.
Example:
    N=4
    append 1
    append 2
    insert 3 1
    print
            1. append 1: Append 1 to the list, arr=[1].
            2. append 2 :append 2 to the list, arr=[1,2]
            3. insert 3 1: Insert 3 at insex 1  , arr=[1,3,2]
            4. print: print the array

Output:
        [1, 3, 2]


Input Format:
        The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of commands.
Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains one of the commands described above.


Constraints:
 The elements added to the list must be integers.


Output Format:
         For each command of type print, print the list on a new line.
